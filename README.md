# Buffer-Overflow-THM

Base exploit for the "Buffer Overflow Prep" room on TryHackMe. The current exploit is set to target the "OVERFLOW2" command so you will need to change this as well as the machine IP variable in the script. You will also need to change the shellcode to your own created with MSFVenom. This script should be used as a guidance to how your exploit should work and not as your own script as it will NOT pwn all the tasks.

More guidance can be seen within the exploit.py script itself.
